V0.2 priority list: 

1) Improving custom recipes(Chinese bowl too bland, Chinese bowl add onion caps to protein, way less details and not properly written, orange paneer not good, no salt, no air fryer options and instructions, ask for topping instuctions in salad)
2) DB changes
	Raita
	verify description and macros of each main and side
	add veg options 
	seasonal veggie?
3) decouple sides and carbsides(independent scaling) portion scaling 
4) refactoring ingredient vectors(new format and deterministic check)
------------------------------		post processing script 
		clubbing multiple ingredients list 
------------------------------		extrapolating the single serve ingredients list 

5) merging multiple member functionality
	add multiple mains and multiple side option and then merge them 
6) Real time macro vector generators 
7) Integrating custom recipes fully into rec_gen 



-> serving size(ss) = m*1 + ep*0.5
	==> main will be scaled with ss, sides and carbsides will be scaled with m
	 (m,ep)= (3,3), ss= 4.5 ==> main will be scaled with 4.5, sides and carbsides will be scaled with 3. 
	==> sides and carb side will be scaled with m.  
-> multiple mains, sides and carbside instances to be merged finally. 

Changes that need to reflect in webapp: 
1) custom string(spicy etc req)
2) roti variant 
3) roti and rice quantity multiplier 
4) proper description of everything
